# Bubbles-Game (for ~2 year olds)
A simple kids game with appearing and disappearing bubbles

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The "game" will work fine on all screen types. It's idea is purely to 
attract the attention of the babies and to make them try it themselves.

# How it works:
All you need to do is to open the project folder, open a console and enter "npm i".
After that is done just open the index.html file and the "game" starts.
When clicking on a blank section of the screen a circle will appear in a random
position with a random color and opacity. 
When you click on an already created circles - it will disappear.
After managing to reach 150 visible circles on the scree - the page will clear itself and
create the first new circle.
